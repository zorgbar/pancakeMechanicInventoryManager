This is a simple android project written in Java used to help a business known as Pancake Mechanic run their day to day operations and manage inventory.

Run on an emulator or connect directly to an Android device and run. 

Created by Caleb4IR (https://github.com/Caleb4IR) and myself for a 3rd year University project.
